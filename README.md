# Potato-Disease-Classification

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify potato leaves into three categories: Late Blight, Early Blight, and Healthy. By analyzing images of potato leaves, the model predicts the disease type and provides a confidence level for its prediction. The application consists of a backend powered by FastAPI, a frontend built with React.js, and a TensorFlow model for image classification.

## Features

### Image Classification:
Upload a leaf photo and get an instant prediction of its health status.

### Disease Categories:

### Confidence Level: 
Get a confidence score for each prediction to understand the model's certainty.

### Interactive UI: 
User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.

### RESTful API: 
Backend service using FastAPI to handle requests and serve predictions.

### Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js   
Backend: FastAPI  
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras  
Programming Language: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
