# Potato-Disease-Classification

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify potato leaves into three categories: Late Blight, Early Blight, and Healthy. By analyzing images of potato leaves, the model predicts the disease type and provides a confidence level for its prediction. The application consists of a backend powered by FastAPI, a frontend built with React.js, and a TensorFlow model for image classification.
